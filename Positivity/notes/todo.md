## NLO prescription
We want to answer the following three questions for:

- DIS
- each kind of process

Guesses:

- **GUESS1:** the answer is indipendent on the specific process because it is mainly related to the incoming parton
- **GUESS2:** probably the dominant term is coming from leftovers from soft (IR) regulrization

### Coefficient function terms
Why does the collinear unsubtracted coefficient functions take the form:

$$ P_ab(z) \times [\log((1-z)/z) + 1/\varepsilon] + \dots $$

### Diagonal terms
Why the diagonal terms are not dangerous while the off-diag yes?

In particular we are unable, for the moment, to determine the product of $ P_aa(z) $ distribution times the non-regular function $ \log(1-z) $.

### Exact log coefficient
Can we proove that the exact coefficient of the dominant term $ \log(1 - z) \times P_ab(1) $ is 1 (or 2 depending on the normalization)?


If we are able to answer these questions we have the correct NLO prescription, that is:

> Subtract $ (1/\varepsilon + 2 \log(1-z)) \times P_ab(z) $ for the off-diag terms and just the pole for the diag ones.
