## UV subtraction

Do we need to worry about UV subtraction?

### If not

If we don't need, how to manage with **collinear unsubtracted** already negative cross sections?
In this case probably we're not able to enforce positivity only redefining the collinear scheme.

e.g.: DIS F2 gluon channel (see Vogt)

## General proof

Once that UV subtraction is tamed, how to achieve a general proof for our collinear subtraction scheme?

### More examples

More examples on which testing our prescription.

#### NNLO

TO DO OR NOT DO?

If yes, how to deal with it?
How the NLO prescription generalize to the NNLO one and even higher?


## Anomalous dimensions and Splitting functions (Vogt)

Expkanation required about Vogt assertions about OPE and splitting functions.
