# Current issues

## UV subtraction

Do we need to worry about UV subtraction?

### If not

If we don't need to, how to manage with *collinear unsubtracted* already negative cross sections?
In this case probably we're not able to enforce positivity only redefining the collinear scheme.

e.g.: DIS F2 gluon channel (see Vogt)

## IR safety

We are only interested in IR safe observables, such as inclusive cross section.
However, during the calculations from phase space terms such as (1-x)^(-1+eps) occur, which render together
with (soft) poles terms proportional log(1-x). These contributions will dominate the behaviour of the
partonic cross sections at x -> 1 and can turn it fully negative, depending on the coefficient - see
DIS F2 gluon channel. As we see, cross section can become negative from large N - why again, are we mostly
concered about the large-N behaviour anyway?

## Dimensional regularisation

We use a *single* regulator `eps` to deal with UV, IR, and collinear singularities simultaniously - is this a problem?

## General proof

Once that UV subtraction is tamed, how to achieve a general proof for our collinear subtraction scheme?

## More examples

We need some more examples on which to test our prescription.

## NNLO

To Do Or Not Do?

If yes, how to deal with it?
How to generalize our current NLO prescription up to NNLO and even higher?


## Anomalous dimensions and Splitting functions (Vogt)

Explanation required about Vogt assertions about OPE and splitting functions.
