Navigator
=========

To enter in the `navigator` simply running ``navigator`` command, installed with
the `yadmark` package.

The script will load the full interface and drop into an `ipython` interpreter
instance, so the interface is available as a set of python functions.
Once inside the interpreter all the functions in:

- the interface
- `pylab`

will be available without any prefix (they are imported in the global namespace).
You can aslo type ``h()`` or ``yelp()`` for a brief overview.
