`yadism` is a wonderful package for computing |DIS| observables replacing the
corresponding one inside |APFEL|.

Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`yadism` present some real advantages with respect to analogous codes
available. They are mainly related to the choice of developing this project
applying a modern methodology.

In particular:

- the project is open source, freely available from an early stage of
  development, open for requests and contributions
- the project has been developed using *python*, because even if it would make
  harder to improve the runtime performances, it will improve enormously
  readability

  - the performances issues are delegated to the use of external compiled
    extensions (like scipy_), relying on very well tested libraries, or even
    using JIT compiled code (or in general python defined compiled code), e.g.
    using numba_

    .. code-block:: shell

       pip install yadism

- another great benefit of the previous point is the delivering and
  portability: the project is deployed on PyPI_ and you can simply download it
  using pip_, simply running:
- the project is managed applying CI/CD patterns, in this way is continuously
  benchmarked at any update, against other tools, itself and preserving
  invariants exploiting a unit-test suite (for a full description see
  :doc:`dev-tools/tests`)
- a lot of attention has been paid in writing a helpful and detailed
  documentation, to help users and future maintainers
