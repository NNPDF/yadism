Unit Tests
==========

Unit tests are provided to test all the components of the package isolated.

Strategy
--------


Minimal
   The setup for each test is kept always minimal, trying to reduce each test to
   its atomic components.
Mocking
   If needed some structures are mocked to be able to run piece of codes the
   depend on the presence of something else.
Errors
   Even the error raising is tested, to ensure its consistency.

Coverage
--------
The testing is checked and guaranteed by coverage metrics.

.. warning::

   The coverage metric used is the one available with the package
   :mod:`pytest`, but it's a little bit na√Øve.

   Indeed the lines of code explored by tests are watched and reported in a
   very comfortable way, but more involved scenarios are ignored.

   *For example*: if a single line of code will contain a branching (inline
   ``if... else...`` structure) it is considered explored even if not all the
   branches are explored by tests.
