Input layer
===========

The input layer parse and validate the user input for launching the actual run,
enforcing:

- single field constraints
- multiple fields constraints (*cross-constraints*)

This layer can be used directly, so it is principle independent from anything
else in `yadism`, but it has been developed to be used mainly inside a `Runner`
instance.
