Kernels
=======

.. todo::

   - describe kernel structure
   - stress that there are four kinds:

     - in *non-singlet* channel allows to reuse a single integration for multiple
       channels, that there the line directly connects to the EW boson
     - in *gluon* and *singlet* the incoming line is always decoupled by a
       *gluon* from the EW and thus naturally appears the charge average (that
       depend on the number of flavors running in the loops)
     - that *intrinsic* is treated separately (heavy-initiated)

   - stress that Charged Current are slightly different from Neutral ones, and
     point to the corresponding theory section
   - describe that kernels are defined as (partons, coefficient) and turned into
     (partons, operator, operator-error) by convolutions


Rearrange Singlet & Non-singlet
-------------------------------

.. todo::

   describe redefinition of the singlet -> pure singlet from Vogt notation

   essentially include the already written note
