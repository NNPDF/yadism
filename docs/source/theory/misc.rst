Target Mass Corrections
-----------------------

Following :cite:`tmc-review`, :cite:`tmc-iranian` we provide three options:

- **exact**: is the full and involves integration
- **approximate**: is stemming from the exact, but the strcture functions in
  the integrand are evaluated at the bottom end
- **APFEL**: the one used in APFEL, similar to the exact but with g2 in
  the review (Schienbein et al.) set to 0

.. _fl-corrections:

:math:`F_L` definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also the definition of :math:`F_L` may be corrected by the presence of a proton
mass.

Isospin
-------

.. todo::

   Isospin is used as a level-0 nuclear correction, just swapping the up and
   down contribution (for the amount it is specified)

Heavy Quark Mass scheme
-----------------------

.. todo::

   it is not yet implemented:

   - Pole masses (implemented)
   - MSbar masses (not implemented)
