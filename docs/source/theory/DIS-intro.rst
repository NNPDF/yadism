Introduction to DIS
===================

History
-------

- Short historical overview "DIS is the process involving [bla bla]"
- "it has been historically relevant in QCD and [bla bla bla]"
- "and it is one of the core element in PDF determination [bla bla bla bla] ..."

Notations
---------

We are following the notations in :cite:`Zyla:2020zbs`, i.e. we're using their
normalization and definitions. So the hadronic tensor is given by

.. math ::
    W_{\mu\nu} = \left(-g_{\mu\nu} + \frac{q_\mu q_\nu}{q^2}\right) F_1(x,Q^2)
                + \frac{\hat P_\mu \hat P_\nu}{P \cdot q} F_2(x,Q^2)
                - i \varepsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} \frac{q^\alpha P^\beta}{2 P\cdot q} F_3(x,Q^2)

with :math:`\hat P_\mu = P_\mu - (P\cdot q / q^2) q_\mu`, :math:`P` the 4-momentum
of the hadron and :math:`q` the 4-momentum of the scattered boson.

Process / Currents
------------------

``yadism`` allows to compute three different type of **processes**, which correspond to a
given set of scattering bosons:

- Electromagnetic Current (|EM|): we only allow the photon to be exchanged. This is the
  most basic setup and in many cases the only allowed option.
- Neutral Current (|NC|): in addition to the photon we also allow for the :math:`Z`
  boson to be exchanged, so this is a superset of |EM|.
  Since now two bosons are allowed also interference terms appear.
  The :math:`Z` boson has an axial coupling to the leptons and thus it introduces the problems
  related to :math:`\gamma_5` :cite:`Gnendiger:2017pys`.
  Note that there are no Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in the |SM|, but they are an
  active field of research.
- Charged Current (|CC|): we only allow the :math:`W^+` *or* :math:`W^-` to be exchanged.
  The actual boson is determined by the incoming scattering lepton and charge conservation.
  As the :math:`W^\pm` are flavor changing additional care is needed in the calculation.

.. _kinds def:

Structure Function Kind
-----------------------

``yadism`` allows to compute three different structure functions, to which we refer to as **kind**:

.. math ::

  F_2,~ F_L = F_2 - 2xF_1,~ xF_3

- to compute :math:`F_L` instead of :math:`F_1` is adventagous due to the Callan-Gross relation
  :cite:`Callan:1969uq` :math:`F_L=0` in the naive parton model

  - notice that the :math:`F_L` definition it's not exactly the one above, but
    it may be corrected (actually :math:`F_L` it's the object involved in
    Callan-Gross relation, for more information see :ref:`fl corrections`)

- Note that we compute :math:`xF_3` instead of the bare structure function to respect the native
  scaling in the full cross section

Target Mass Corrections
-----------------------

Following :cite:`tmc-review`, :cite:`tmc-iranian` we provide three options:

- **exact**: is the full and involves integration
- **approximate**: is stemming from the exact, but the strcture functions in
  the integrand are evaluated at the bottom end
- **APFEL**: the one used in APFEL, similar to the exact but with g2 in
  the review (Schienbein et al.) set to 0

.. _fl corrections:

:math:`F_L` definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also the definition of :math:`F_L` may be corrected by the presence of a proton
mass.
