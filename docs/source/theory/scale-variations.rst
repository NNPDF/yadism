Scale Variations
================

The coefficient functions may depend on a factorization scale :math:`\mu_F^2` and on a
renormalization scale :math:`\mu_R^2`. Both scales are unphysical and enter via a |RGE|, i.e. the
full object is independet on the specific choice.

The factorization scale is a relic of the collinear factorization theorem and thus
related to the |PDF| scheme. It can be seen as an infra-red cut-off that seperates the perturbative
hard matrix element and the un-perturbative |PDF|. The explicit dependence on :math:`\mu_F^2` is
generated by convolutions of splitting functions with lower order coefficient functions
:cite:`AbdulKhalek:2019ihb,vogt-sv`.

The renormalization scale is a relic of the Lagrange renormalization procedure and thus related
to the coupling scheme. It can be seen as an ultra-violet cut-off that seperates the perturbative
hard matrix element and the running coupling, that resums a specific class of terms. The explicit
dependence on :math:`\mu_R^2` is generated by inserting the |RGE|, i.e. the beta function, into
the expanded coefficient functions :cite:`AbdulKhalek:2019ihb,vogt-sv`.

Varying the scales in the context of |PDF| determination only in the coefficient functions
corresponds to scheme C in :cite:`AbdulKhalek:2019ihb`.
