Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials provide a brief introduction on some of the main features of `yadism`.
These tutorials have four main objectives, namely to introduce the user on how to:

* prepare the observable and theory cards required for any yadism computationcompute 
* compute observables by convoluting yadism predictions to PDFs (Parton Distribution Functions)
* tabulate the yadism predictions into fast-interpolation grids for later use
