Tutorials
=========

The following tutorials provide a brief introduction on some of the main features of `yadism`.
These tutorials show how to:

* prepare the observable and theory cards required for any yadism computation
* compute observables by convoluting yadism predictions with a |PDF|
* tabulate the yadism predictions into fast-interpolation grids for later use
* compute a DIS observable with the FONLL scheme
