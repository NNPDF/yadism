Note
----

We currently chose not to use any default, in order to force the user to provide a
fully explicit input.
Even if in this way it will be a little bit more difficult to learn how to use
`yadism` it is not intended to be used by people not aware of its inputs.

Instead we are going to provide one or more example inputs in the project (or
project docs) and each field is fully described inside this subpackage in
:mod:`domains.yaml`.
