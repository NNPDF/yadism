# Cross argument constraints
# --------------------------
#
# In this file are stored the cross constraints on the input arguments values.
#
# Syntax
# ------
#
# the following is a list of objects (dicts) each one containing the following
# fields
#
# - name: (optional)
#     a name for the rule, acts as a short description and ID
# - involve: list of arguments involved
# - description:
#     strring or list of strings: description of the rule and why is needed,
#     also available as a list to refer separetely to each rule
# - rules: list of constraints on the set of arguments declared in involve
# - hints: (optional)
#     hint or list of hints raised to the user with the exception
#     if only one supplied it applies to all the rules, otherwise if a list is
#     provided each element referred the rule in the same position (hints should
#     be less than or equal to the number of rules)
# - metavars: (optional)
#     the name is used to represent the variable in the rules specified in the
#     'rules' field
#     list or dict: in the first case they are bound to arguments in the same
#     order they are listed in 'involve' field, if a dict the values are bound
#     to arguments declared in the keys
#
# Note
# ----
#
# The rationale of having more rules in the same element is to be able to group
# rules in sections of similar or related ones (because they involve the same
# arguments but not only).

- name: Renormalization - Factorization scales ratio
  involve:
    - krenQ
    - kfacQ
    - ScVarProc
  description: >
    *
    *     Additional settings
    *
    krenQ = kfacQ = 1

    in this case there is no fallback, but instead is doing something (call
    SetRenFacRatio, i.e. sets an internal parameter in a common block)

    furthermore:

    ScVarProc = 1 --> SetRenFacRatio(1.)
  rules:
